    "This answer should be easy to get, surely, because Django is hosted on GitHub. \n",

    "Well, yes, but more goes into a release of Django than just GitHub. There's also the separate ticketing system and translations, just to name two of the major systems involved. \n",

    "\n",
    "To start: which version do we want to get the information for? In this case, 4.1. (Noting of course that this data may still be in flux as this is still the current minor version, and will still have data changes until it is EOL'd some time in 2023 or there abouts.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also the information just in the comments themselves: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The author and the committer (not always the same person)\n",
    "* The Trac issue (often in the comment message itself)\n",
    "* Any manual thanks (often in the case of security fixes) as part of the message\n",
    "* Any discussions in attached pull requests. \n",
